<h2>List packages in CRAN incoming queue.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check where your package stands in the CRAN incoming queue.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
cran_incoming(
  pkg = NULL,
  folders = c("newbies", "inspect", "pretest", "recheck", "pending", "publish",
    "archive", "waiting")
)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pkg</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optionally provide a vector of package names to limit the results
to these packages.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>folders</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which folders of the CRAN FTP site do you want to inspect? Default:
all the non-human folders.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>When submitting a package to CRAN, it undergoes a series of checks before it
is published and publicly available. <code>cran_incoming()</code> allows you to check
the packages that are currently in the queue, and the folder where they are
located. This information could help you track your package submission. Only
the following folders are considered (approximately in order of the CRAN
queue sequence): <code>newbies</code>, <code>inspect</code>, <code>pretest</code>, <code>recheck</code>, <code>pending</code>,
<code>waiting</code>, <code>publish</code>, <code>archive</code>. The folders named after the initials of the
CRAN volunteers are not inspected.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>tibble</code> with the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>package</dt><dd><p>package name</p>
</dd>
<dt>version</dt><dd><p>package version</p>
</dd>
<dt>cran_folder</dt><dd><p>folder where the package was found</p>
</dd>
<dt>time</dt><dd><p>date/time package was entered in the folder</p>
</dd>
</dl>



<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>The information provided here is only to give you an indication of where
your package stands in the submission process. It can be useful to confirm
that your package has been correctly uploaded to CRAN. Please consult the
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html">CRAN Repository Policy</a> if you have
any questions.
